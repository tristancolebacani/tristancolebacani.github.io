    <h2>Who Is <span class="tealText">She</span>?</h2>
    <p>
      Tristan Cole Bacani is a 19 year old musician and future engineer. Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, she
      moved across the country to pursue her bachelors degree in Biomedical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability to innovate impactful solutions is what drew Tristan to enineering. She is driven by the ability to create models, 
      prototypes, and experiments that can benefit society. Her dream of combining music and technology, as well as equity through
      engineering. She strives to advocate for women in STEAM and share her own experience as a minority woman in tech through outreach and dialogue.

      "Our research focuses on understanding and improving movement mechanics used during athletic and everyday maneuvers.
       Specifically, we are interested in (1) uncovering strategies people use to achieve the mechanical objectives of turning maneuvers and 
       (2) developing interactive sonification as a modality of personalized biofeedback. Sonificatied biofeedback conveys biomechanics metrics via sound. 
       We are developing systems with which people can interactively “tune” music biofeedback to tune their movement strategies."
